RedDot is an institution-level precision signals engine designed for BTC/USD and ETH/USD. It provides a real-time dashboard for traders to visualize signals from a momentum-based strategy, configure granular risk parameters, and instantly backtest the strategy's performance against historical data.

This document serves as a comprehensive guide to the application's features, trading strategy, and technical architecture.

## üìà The RedDot Strategy: Capturing Momentum

The core philosophy of the RedDot strategy is to identify and capture momentum in trending markets while filtering out noise from sideways or "choppy" price action.

### Signal Generation Logic

The signal is generated through a two-step process to ensure accuracy:

1.  **Dual EMA Crossover:** The system first identifies a crossover between the fast **13-period EMA** and the slow **48-period EMA**. This indicates a potential shift in market momentum.
2.  **Momentum Confirmation:** A signal is only triggered on the *next* candle if the spread between the two EMAs widens. This confirms that the new momentum is accelerating, reducing false signals during periods of low conviction.
    -   **BUY Signal:** 13 EMA crosses *above* 48 EMA, and the distance between them increases.
    -   **SELL Signal:** 13 EMA crosses *below* 48 EMA, and the distance between them increases.

### Trade Management & Exits

The system employs a clear hierarchy of exit conditions to manage trades:

1.  **Primary Exit (Trend Reversal):** The main exit condition is a crossover in the opposite direction (13 EMA crossing back over the 48 EMA), signaling that the trend has likely ended.
2.  **Protective Exits (Stop Loss / Trailing Stop):** Each trade has a calculated initial stop loss. If enabled, a trailing stop will automatically move the stop loss to lock in profits as the trade moves favorably.
3.  **Systematic Exit (Opposing Signal):** An open position is automatically closed if a new, opposing signal is generated, ensuring the system is always aligned with the latest market signal.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Real-Time Signal Dashboard:** Live BUY/SELL/HOLD signals for BTC/USD and ETH/USD across multiple timeframes.
-   **Interactive TradingView Chart:** A professional-grade chart that visualizes price action and overlays signal markers, entries, exits, and stop-loss levels.
-   **Dynamic Backtesting Engine:** The "Trade History" table instantly simulates the strategy's performance with your custom settings, providing immediate feedback on how risk parameters affect outcomes.
-   **Advanced Risk Management Panel:** Configure portfolio size, margin per trade, leverage, risk models (% vs. fixed $), and trailing stop parameters.
-   **Detailed Trade Analytics:** Click any historical trade to open a modal with a focused chart view and a detailed P/L breakdown for that specific trade.
-   **Instant Trade Alerts:** Execution-ready alerts are generated for new signals, containing all necessary parameters to place a trade.

## üöÄ Application Workflow

The dashboard is designed for an intuitive, cyclical workflow of analysis and configuration:

1.  **Configure Risk:** In the **"Trade Setup & Risk Management"** panel, set your portfolio size, margin, trade type (Spot/Margin/Contracts), leverage, and risk model.
2.  **Select Market:** At the top of the screen, choose a `Pair` (BTC/USD or ETH/USD) and a `Timeframe` (1m to 1H).
3.  **Analyze Performance:**
    -   Observe the current signal in the **Signal Indicator**.
    -   Review the **Trade History** table to see how your settings would have performed. Note the P/L, win rate, and exit reasons.
4.  **Review Trades:** Click any row in the history table to launch the **Trade Review** modal. This shows a dedicated chart for that trade's duration, helping you understand its context.
5.  **Refine & Repeat:** Adjust your risk settings in the panel. The Trade History will instantly update, allowing you to fine-tune your approach.

## üíª Architecture & Code Deep Dive

The application is built with a modern React hooks-based architecture, emphasizing a clear separation of concerns between state management, business logic, API services, and UI components.

### Data Flow

The application follows a unidirectional data flow orchestrated by the main `App.tsx` component:

1.  **User Action:** A user changes a setting in the `TradeSetupPanel`.
2.  **State Update:** The `useTradeSettings` hook updates the application's settings state.
3.  **Data Re-computation:** `App.tsx` passes the new settings to the `useSignalData` and `useTradeHistory` hooks. These hooks re-run their memoized calculations:
    -   `useSignalData` recalculates stop-loss markers for the chart.
    -   `useTradeHistory` runs the entire backtest simulation from scratch with the new parameters.
4.  **UI Re-render:** React efficiently re-renders the components (`CryptoChart`, `SignalHistoryTable`) that depend on the new data, displaying the updated results.

### Core Logic: Custom Hooks (`/hooks`)

The application's "brain" is contained within three custom hooks:

-   `useTradeSettings.ts`: The single source of truth for all user-configurable parameters. It manages the state for the risk panel and computes the `notionalCapital`.
-   `useSignalData.ts`: The data fetching and processing layer. It handles API calls to CryptoCompare, polls for new data, adds indicators via `indicatorUtils`, and identifies the latest signal.
-   `useTradeHistory.ts`: The backtesting engine. It iterates through the signal data, simulates entries and exits based on the strategy rules and user settings, and calculates the P/L for each trade.

### UI Layer: Components (`/components`)

-   `App.tsx`: The top-level component that orchestrates the entire application. It initializes the custom hooks and passes state and data down to the child UI components.
-   `CryptoChart.tsx`: A sophisticated wrapper for the TradingView widget. It is responsible for rendering the main chart and dynamically drawing signal markers and detailed trade overlays (entry, exit, SL).
-   `TradeSetupPanel.tsx`: The primary form where users interact with and modify all risk and trade settings.
-   `SignalHistoryTable.tsx`: Displays the complex output of the `useTradeHistory` hook in a clean, paginated, and interactive table.
-   `TradeDetailModal.tsx`: A specialized view that combines the `CryptoChart` with statistical data to provide an in-depth review of a single historical trade.

### Services & Utilities

-   `services/cryptoService.ts`: Isolates all API communication with the CryptoCompare API, keeping data fetching logic separate from the application state.
-   `utils/indicatorUtils.ts` & `utils/tradeUtils.ts`: Contain pure, testable functions for the core business logic. `indicatorUtils` calculates EMAs and signals, while `tradeUtils` calculates position sizes, stop-loss/take-profit levels, and formats trade alerts.
